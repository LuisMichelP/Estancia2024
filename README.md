The objective of the project consists of creating a model that replicates the results obtained by Dr. Juan Ivan Gomez Peralta et al. in J. Appl. Cryst. and J. Phys. Chem. A. The models will be based on the use of multilayer neural networks or multivariable linear regression through transfer learning from a previously trained deep neural network.
